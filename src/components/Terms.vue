        <p>The original Proof-of-Work consensus used by Bitcoin is now the breakthrough where it all began. For more than eight years in running, Bitcoin’s system has certainly proved its reliability.</p>
        <p>However, the rising energy consumption and centralized mining pools have become targets of criticism. This is why Proof-of-Stake consensus was introduced in 2012 through Peercoin [King 2012]. The major difference between Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake is that instead of allocating weight based on computing resource consumption as in the case of Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake consensus systems allocate weight relative to the amount of coin holdings participating in the consensus activity, also known as block minting. This algorithm decouples the consensus security level from system energy consumption level and eliminates the requirement of energy consumption in order to reach consensus, thereby resolving the energy concerns over Proof-of-Work, while reducing overall system operating cost in the process. Proof-of-Stake consensus is a major breakthrough as it significantly lowers the cost of blockchain technology and thus the entry barrier, enabling a vastly diversified blockchain ecosystem.</p>
        <p> Nevertheless, there are concerns over Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, including the lack of incentives for nodes to perform hardware upgrades and the random process of block generation. These are proven to be major obstacles to scaling blockchain. And after careful evaluation, our team has devised the brand new Supernode Proof-of-Stake (SPoS) consensus, to both incorporate the goods and discard the bads with the old mechanisms. SPoS consensus will serve as the enabling technology for blockchain to reach a global scale.</p>
        <p> Supernode Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism dictates that elevated nodes (supernodes) act as minting pools while holders of VCoin, native currency of the blockchain, take up the role as minters through leasing their coins to supernodes. Interests will be paid to coin owners who leased their coins to supernodes for minting. This new incentive model does not only ensure the quality of the nodes, but also guarantee a truly decentralized ecosystem where VCoin owners have the actual power to govern the network. At the same time, the system also allows for contention to be supernodes at any moment through determining a winner among contenders by comparing their minting average balance. This innovative mathematical approach ensures the system carries enough stake liquidity while reduces busy contention attack. More detailed information regarding the Supernode Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism is available in the SPoS whitepaper.</p>
